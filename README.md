### High level description of project
For the last few years we noticed a growth of yellow journalism due to technology development and social media usage. Fake news encapsulates news that may be hoaxes and usually spread through social media. Usually the main reason is to further spread or impose certain ideas. Such news containing false or claims end up being vitalused by algorithms.

### Intro
This project explored a dataset of about 44898 fake and real news. The goal of this project is to use this dataset to build an algorithm that would identify wether a news is fake or not. 

The dataset was obtained from Kaggel. The explored dataset consisted of two documents with news (already labeled as true or fake) published between March 30, 2015 and February 18, 2018.
